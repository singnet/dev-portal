Welcome to the [SingularityNET Developer Portal](https://dev.singularitynet.io).

Our Developer Portal provides documentation about the SingularityNET Platform and Marketplace. As a service developer, you will learn how to build and access AI services that are published onto the network. As a client of SingularityNET services, you learn to integrate your software with SingularityNET services that other people have published.

The beta Marketplace is online at [beta.singularitynet.io](http://beta.singularitynet.io), and allows you browse a curated set of services that are available in the registry.

If you're new to SingularityNET, this is the suggested order in which to explore the developer portal. For everyone else, it's hopefully a good index to find the information you need.


## First Steps

The consumer of SingularityNET services can use the following first three relevant links,  to publish a service, test the service and understand the preference of customers.

- [Prerequisities](/docs/setup/requirements) - What do you need to do before you can start working with decentralised AI services.
- [Create a Wallet](/docs/setup/create-a-wallet) - To make transactions you'll need a wallet with some funds.
- [How to call a service](/docs/setup/call-a-service) - Covers trying out a service in the marketplace, and calling it from our command line tool.
- [Using the SDK](/tutorials/sdk) - Calling a service using the Python SDK.

The following instructions guide you create a service, and help upload that service on the marketplace:

- [Publish and run your own example service](/tutorials/publish)
- [Marketplace Requirements for Services](/docs/ai-developers/marketplace) - How to submit your service for inclusion in the Singularity marketplace. The marketplace is a curated view of services available in the registry.
