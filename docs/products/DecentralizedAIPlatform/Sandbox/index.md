# What is UI Sandbox?

UI Sandbox is a powerful and versatile development environment that provides tools for creating custom modules and services, online compilation, fast file upload and export, and a library of components for accelerated interface development. The environment supports flexible customization, allows you to write and compile code, create and reuse modules, and share them with other developers, making the development process as flexible and efficient as possible.

## Why use Sandbox?

- Create your own modules: the platform allows you to not only write code, but also create modules that can be reused or shared with other developers. This makes the development process more flexible and efficient.

- Component Library: a library of frontend components is available that you can use in your projects. This speeds up the development of user interfaces and allows you to quickly integrate out-of-the-box solutions.

- Upload and download files: Support for uploading and downloading files makes it easier to work with your projects, allowing you to easily transfer them between devices and different development environments.

This development environment is not just an editor, but a complete tool for creating, managing and compiling code.
