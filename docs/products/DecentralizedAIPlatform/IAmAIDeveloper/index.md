**SingularityNET (SNET)** is a platform that allows developers to publish and monetize their AI services through blockchain. Any user across the internet can access these services. An internal token - ASI (FET), is used for payment.

## Platform Capabilities

---

The platform covers a wide range of services in the field of AI and machine learning:

### **Supported Service Types**

- **Model inference and training** - Deploy pre-trained models or offer training services
- **Image and video processing** - Computer vision, object detection, image generation
- **Speech and text analysis** - NLP, translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition
- **Time series analysis** - Predictive analytics, forecasting, anomaly detection
- **Biological data processing** - Genomics, proteomics, medical imaging analysis
- **Network analytics** - Graph analysis, social network analysis, recommendation systems

### **Service Complexity Range**

You can offer anything from:
- **Simple algorithms** - Pathfinding, sorting, optimization algorithms
- **Industry-specific solutions** - Complete end-to-end products for healthcare, finance, logistics
- **Standalone AI applications** - Full-featured applications with AI at their core
- **Autonomous AI agents** - Services that can interact with other platform services

## Architecture Overview

---

SingularityNET consists of several key components that ensure its operation:

### **Core Design Principles**

- **Blockchain Independence** - Minimizing dependency on specific blockchains like [Ethereum](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/UsedTechnologies/ethereum-address/) to increase speed and reduce costs
- **Abstraction Layer** - Universal approach to integrating AI services, simplifying the [publishing](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/OnboardingViaPublisher/) and usage process
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Support for regulatory requirements without sacrificing platform openness

### **Technical Infrastructure**

- **Smart Contracts** - Handle service registration, payments, and governance
- **Decentralized Storage** - IPFS and Filecoin for metadata and service definitions
- **Daemon Service** - Manages service calls, payments, and authentication
- **Multi-Party Escrow** - Secure payment channels for efficient transactions

## Developer Benefits

---

### **Simplicity and Ease of Use**

The platform is designed to be developer-friendly:
- **Universal Tool** - The [Daemon](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/Daemon/) handles all complex operations
- **Comprehensive SDKs** - Available for Python, JavaScript, and Java
- **Clear Documentation** - Step-by-step guides for every stage of development
- **Testing Environment** - Sepolia testnet for risk-free experimentation

### **Scalability and Performance**

Your services can handle enterprise-level demands:
- **High throughput** - Efficient request handling through optimized daemon architecture
- **Load balancing** - Built-in support for distributed service deployment
- **State management** - ETCD for reliable state persistence across instances
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in metrics and logging capabilities

### **Openness and Decentralization**

True decentralization with practical benefits:
- **No vendor lock-in** - Services remain under your complete control
- **Transparent pricing** - Set your own pricing models and payment terms
- **Global accessibility** - Reach users worldwide without intermediaries
- **Interoperability** - Services can interact with each other seamlessly

## Getting Started Guide

---

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **AI Service** - A working AI model or service ready for deployment
2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Python 3.10+ or compatible runtime for your service
   - Protocol Buffer definitions for your service API
   - Server or VM with public IP/domain
3. **Blockchain Requirements**:
   - Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
   - Small amount of ETH for gas fees (~0.01 ETH)

### **Quick Start Steps**

1. **Prepare Your Service** - [Follow the preparation guide](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/QuickStartGuides/GettingReadyToOnboardCheckUp/)
2. **Register on Publisher Portal** - Create your account at [publisher.singularitynet.io](https://publisher.singularitynet.io)
3. **Deploy Infrastructure** - Set up Daemon and ETCD following our guides
4. **Publish Your Service** - Use Publisher Portal or CLI/TUI for publishing
5. **Test and Verify** - Ensure your service works correctly on testnet first

## Publishing Options

---

### **Publisher Portal (Recommended)**

Best for developers who want marketplace visibility:
- **Visual interface** - User-friendly web-based publishing
- **Marketplace listing** - Automatic inclusion in AI Marketplace
- **UI support** - Option to add custom UI for your service
- **Analytics** - Built-in usage statistics and monitoring

### **CLI/TUI Publishing**

Best for programmatic deployment and automation:
- **Automation-friendly** - Scriptable deployment process
- **Direct control** - Fine-grained configuration options
- **SDK-only services** - Perfect for B2B integrations
- **CI/CD integration** - Easily integrate with deployment pipelines

## Monetization Models

---

### **Pricing Strategies**

Choose the pricing model that fits your service:

- **Pay-per-call** - Charge for each API call
- **Tiered pricing** - Different rates for different service levels
- **Method-specific pricing** - Vary prices based on complexity
- **Free tier** - Offer trial calls to attract users

### **Payment Processing**

Efficient and secure payment handling:
- **ASI (FET) tokens** - Native platform currency
- **Payment channels** - No per-transaction blockchain fees
- **Automatic settlement** - Funds directly to your wallet
- **PayPal integration** - Fiat currency support via marketplace
