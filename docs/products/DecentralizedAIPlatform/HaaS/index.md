# Hosting-as-a-Service (HaaS)

## What is HaaS?

**Hosting-as-a-Service (HaaS)** is a managed infrastructure solution that eliminates the need to deploy and maintain your own daemon instances. Instead of handling installation, environment setup, and server provisioning manually, you provide your service configuration, and the platform automatically provisions, deploys, and manages the daemon for you.

Each HaaS deployment runs in an isolated, containerized environment with:

- Dedicated virtual machine
- Pre-configured runtime environment
- Automated daemon deployment and lifecycle management
- Built-in payment channel storage (ETCD)
- Automated infrastructure updates and maintenance

---

## HaaS vs Self-Hosted Daemon

Choose the deployment method that best fits your needs:

| Aspect | HaaS (Managed) | Self-Hosted Daemon |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Infrastructure Setup** | ✅ Fully automated | ⚠️ Manual configuration required |
| **Server Management** | ✅ Managed by platform | ❌ You maintain servers |
| **ETCD Configuration** | ✅ Pre-configured | ⚠️ Manual setup required |
| **SSL Certificates** | ✅ Handled automatically | ⚠️ You manage certificates |
| **Updates & Maintenance** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual updates |
| **Technical Expertise** | Beginner-friendly | Advanced |
| **Cost Structure** | Monthly subscription (FET tokens) | Infrastructure costs only |
| **Scalability** | ✅ Easy scaling | ⚠️ Manual scaling |

---

## When to Use HaaS

**Choose HaaS if:**

✅ You want to focus on AI service development, not infrastructure  
✅ You need quick deployment without server management  
✅ You prefer predictable monthly costs  
✅ You don't want to handle ETCD, SSL, or daemon configuration  
✅ You need reliable uptime with automated maintenance  

---

## When to Use Self-Hosted Daemon

**Choose Self-Hosted if:**

✅ You need full control over infrastructure  
✅ You have existing server infrastructure  
✅ You want to minimize recurring costs  
✅ You require custom daemon configurations  
✅ You have DevOps expertise  

> For self-hosted deployment instructions, see the [Full Onboarding Guide](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/FullGuideOnboarding/).

## Prerequisites

Before deploying with HaaS, ensure you have:

1. **Published Service**: Your service must be created through the Publisher Portal (Steps 1 and 2 completed)
2. **AI Service Running**: Your actual AI service must be deployed and accessible via HTTP/HTTPS endpoint
3. **MetaMask Wallet**: With sufficient FET tokens for monthly subscription payment
4. **Service Endpoint**: Public URL where your AI service is accessible (e.g., `https://your-service.example.com`)
5. **Authorization** (optional): API keys or authorization headers if your service requires authentication

---

## Deploying Your Daemon with HaaS

### Step 1: Access HaaS During Service Creation

After completing the first two steps of service creation in the Publisher Portal, you'll see the daemon configuration step. At the top of this page, you'll find:

**"TRY OUR HOSTING  
DEPLOY DAEMON IN ONE CLICK"**

Click this section to open the HaaS setup wizard.

---

### Step 2: Configure Daemon Hosting

The **Daemon Hosting Payment** modal will appear with the following fields:

#### Required Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Monthly Cost** | Subscription price in FET tokens (displayed automatically) | `100 FET/month` |
| **Service Endpoint** | Public URL where your AI service is running | `https://api.yourservice.com` |

#### Optional Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Authorization Keys** | API keys, tokens, or headers if your service requires authentication | `Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN` |

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/haas/haas-payment-modal.png" alt="HaaS Payment Configuration"/>

> 📌 **Note:** Ensure your **Service Endpoint** is publicly accessible and properly configured to handle requests from the HaaS daemon.

---

### Step 3: Create and Pay

1. Click the **Create** button after filling in the required fields
2. MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction
3. Approve the FET token payment for your first month of hosting

The transaction covers:
- Virtual machine provisioning
- Daemon deployment
- ETCD storage setup
- SSL certificate configuration
- One month of hosting service

---

### Step 4: Automatic Configuration

Once payment is confirmed, the platform automatically:

✅ Provisions dedicated infrastructure  
✅ Deploys and configures the daemon  
✅ Generates and applies SSL certificates  
✅ Sets up payment channel storage (ETCD)  
✅ Populates daemon configuration in your service settings  

You'll see these fields automatically filled in your service configuration:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Daemon Endpoint** | Public HTTPS endpoint for your hosted daemon |
| **Free Call Signer Address** | Ethereum address for free call authentication |

<ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/haas/haas-auto-filled.png" alt="Auto-filled Daemon Configuration"/>

> ✨ **No ETCD configuration required** — HaaS uses a managed ETCD cluster automatically.

---

### Step 5: Complete Service Publication

After HaaS successfully deploys your daemon, complete the remaining service publication steps in the Publisher Portal. Your service is now live with a fully managed daemon infrastructure!

---

## Managing Your HaaS Daemons

### Accessing the HaaS Dashboard

Navigate to the **HaaS** section in the left sidebar of the Publisher Portal to view all your hosted daemons.

## Payment and Billing

### Subscription Model

HaaS operates on a **monthly subscription basis** paid in FET tokens:

- Payment is required **upfront** for each subscription period
- Subscription automatically expires if not renewed
- You can top up at any time to extend the expiry date
- Multiple daemons require separate subscriptions

---

### Important Payment Notes

⚠️ **Subscription Management:**
- Monitor your daemon's expiry date in the dashboard
- Top up before expiry to maintain continuous service
- Expired daemons enter `DOWN` status and stop processing requests

⚠️ **Fund Management:**
- Service call payments accumulate in the daemon's payment channels
- Use **Run For Claiming** regularly to withdraw earnings
- Unclaimed funds remain accessible even after subscription expiry
