# Guide to Publishing an Organization and Service via TUI

## Why Choose TUI?

The Text User Interface (TUI) provides a **terminal-based menu system** that guides you through the publishing process step by step. This method strikes a balance between the simplicity of a GUI and the power of command-line tools.

### Method Comparison

| Aspect | TUI | Publisher Portal | CLI |
|--------|-----|-----------------|-----|
| **Interface** | Terminal menus | Web browser GUI | Command line |
| **Marketplace UI Demo** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (optional) | ❌ No |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Easy | Steep |
| **Remote Access** | ✅ SSH-friendly | ❌ Requires browser | ✅ SSH-friendly |
| **Navigation** | ✅ Menu-driven | ✅ Point-and-click | ⚠️ Command memory |

### When to Use TUI

**Choose this method if:**
- You prefer terminal environments but want guided assistance
- You're working on remote servers without GUI access
- You need to manage services over SSH connections
- You don't want to memorize CLI commands
- You like the efficiency of keyboard navigation
- You want a middle ground between GUI and CLI

### Limitations to Consider

- **No marketplace UI demo** - Services are only accessible via CLI/SDK
- **Terminal dependency** - Requires terminal emulator
- **Less flexible than CLI** - Cannot be easily scripted
- **No automation support** - Manual interaction required

### Service Accessibility After Publishing

Services published via TUI are accessible through:
- **CLI** - Developers can call via snet-cli
- **SDK** - Integration into applications (Python, JavaScript, Java)
- **Marketplace Web UI** - No demo interface available

> **Important:** Like CLI, services published via TUI cannot have marketplace UI demos. Users must use programmatic methods to interact with your service.

### Perfect Use Cases

TUI excels in these scenarios:
- **Server administration** - Managing services on headless servers
- **Remote deployment** - Publishing services over SSH
- **Terminal preference** - When you prefer keyboard over mouse
- **Learning phase** - Transitioning from GUI to CLI
- **Cross-platform** - Works consistently across Windows, Linux, macOS

### Interactive Experience

TUI offers unique advantages:
- **No command memorization** - Navigate with arrow keys
- **Visual feedback** - See options and current selections
- **Error prevention** - Invalid options are not selectable
- **Consistent workflow** - Same menu structure every time

### Alternative Methods

Not sure if TUI is right for you? Check the [Full Onboarding Guide](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/FullGuideOnboarding/) for a detailed comparison of all three methods:
- **[Publisher Portal](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/OnboardingViaPublisher/)** - Web GUI with marketplace demo capability
- **[CLI](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/OnboardingViaCLI/)** - Direct commands for automation and scripting

## Step 1: Install

Start by cloning the Github repo with the following command
:::code_group

```sh
cd <FolderPath>
git clone https://github.com/singnet/TUI.git
```

## Step 2: Execute script

After cloning the repo, all you have to do is call the "run" script designed for your operating system.

:::code-group

```powershell [Windows]
cd <TUI Repo Path>
# Call the run script
.\windows_run.bat
```

```sh [Linux]
cd <TUI Repo Path>
# make the script executable
chmod +x linux_run.sh
# Call the run script
./linux_run.sh
```

```sh [MacOS]
cd <TUI Repo Path>
# make the script executable
chmod +x macos_run.sh
# Call the run script
./macos_run.sh
```
