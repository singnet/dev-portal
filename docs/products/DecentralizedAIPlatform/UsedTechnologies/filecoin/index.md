# FileCoin

If you want to use FileCoin as a storage instead of IPFS, this article is for you! Follow the steps in the 
[usage](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/DevelopersTutorials/ServiceOnboardingViaCLI/#using-filecoin) section.

## Core concepts

[FileCoin](https://filecoin.io/) is a decentralized storage network that brings scalability, security, and privacy 
to decentralized storage.

We use [Lighthouse](https://www.lighthouse.storage/) which works on FileCoin. Lighthouse is a perpetual file storage 
protocol that allows you to pay once for your files and store them long-term.

On the SingularityNET platform service providers can choose which storage to use for metadata and service 
(like .proto, etc.) files. Invoking services via AI Marketplace and publishing organizations/services via 
Publisher Portal will be available in the next version of the FileCoin integration.
