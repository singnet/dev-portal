Here’s the complete documentation with the example configuration added at the end:


## How to Create & Start Daemon (Billing & Service Setup)

### Preparation Steps:

1. **Generate an API Key in Alchemy**  
   Follow the [Alchemy API Key Setup Guide](/docs/products/DecentralizedAIPlatform/Daemon/alchemy-api/) to create and obtain your API key. This key will be used by your daemon to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

   After obtaining the API key, you will need to add the following fields to your daemon configuration:

   - **For Mainnet:**  
     ```json
     "ethereum_json_rpc_http_endpoint": "http://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>",
     "ethereum_json_rpc_ws_endpoint": "wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>"
     ```

   - **For Testnet (Sepolia):**  
     ```json
     "ethereum_json_rpc_http_endpoint": "http://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>",
     "ethereum_json_rpc_ws_endpoint": "wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>"
     ```

   Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the API key you copied from Alchemy.

2. **Specify the Private Key for Metering in the Daemon Config**  
   The `pvt_key_for_metering` field in the daemon configuration requires the **private key of an Ethereum wallet**.  

3. **Configure the Service Endpoint**  
   The `service_endpoint` is the endpoint where your service is hosted. The daemon will send user requests to this endpoint.

4. **Finalize the Daemon Config**  
   Copy config or download a JSON file

### Example Daemon Configuration

Here’s an example of a complete daemon configuration file:

```json
{
    "blockchain_enabled": true,
    "blockchain_network_selected": "sepolia",
    "daemon_endpoint": "0.0.0.0:62401",
    "daemon_group_name": "default_group",
    "ipfs_endpoint": "http://ipfs.singularitynet.io:80",
    "organization_id": "Naint1",
    "service_id": "ServNaint7",
    "service_endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:7004",
    "payment_channel_cert_path": "/home/nlp/certs/cfssl/client.pem",
    "payment_channel_ca_path": "/home/nlp/certs/cfssl/ca.pem",
    "payment_channel_key_path": "/home/nlp/certs/cfssl/client-key.pem",
    "ssl_cert": "/home/nlp/certs/domain/fullchain.pem",
    "ssl_key": "/home/nlp/certs/domain/privkey.pem",
    "payment_channel_storage_type": "etcd",
    "pvt_key_for_metering": "<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>",
    "ethereum_json_rpc_http_endpoint": "http://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    "ethereum_json_rpc_ws_endpoint": "wss://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>",
    "log": { "level": "debug", "output": { "type": "stdout" } }
}
```

### Fields to Replace:
- `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>`: Replace with your Ethereum wallet’s private key.
- `<YOUR_API_KEY>`: Replace with your Alchemy API key.

### Now we will install the daemon and run it with the downloaded config

1. Download daemon config according to your system
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/DownloadDaemon.webp" alt="Download Daemon"/>

2. Change rules on Daemon file using ‘chmod’ util

```sh
chmod +x snetd-linux-amd64-v5.2
```

3. Start screen util (If you haven't this util you need install it). It is necessary that the session with started demon does not end when you close terminal.
   screen -S YourName
   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/ChmodAndScreenCommands.webp" alt="Screen"/>
4. Start Daemon in this session

```sh
./snetd-linux-amd64-v5.2 -c snetd.config.json
```

   <ImageViewer src="/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/publisher/ConfigPowershell.webp" alt=" Config"/>
5. Press Ctrl + A + D to disconnect from screen session
6. Check daemon:

```sh
curl localhost:62401/heartbeat
```
