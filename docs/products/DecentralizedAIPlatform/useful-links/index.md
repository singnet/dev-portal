#### **AI Marketplaces**

1. [AI Marketplace Mainnet](https://beta.singularitynet.io/)  
   The main platform for live AI services. Users can browse, purchase, and interact with AI services deployed on the Mainnet.

2. [AI Marketplace Testnet](https://testnet-marketplace.singularitynet.io/)  
   A private environment for testing AI services on the Testnet. Services published in this environment are only visible to the publisher and cannot be seen by others, nor can the publisher view services from others.


_How it works:_ In the **Publisher Portal**, users create organizations and publish services that can then be accessed and utilized on the AI Marketplaces.

#### **Publisher Portals**

1. [Publisher Portal Mainnet](https://publisher.singularitynet.io/)  
   The main Publisher portal for deploying and configuring AI services to the Mainnet.

2. [Publisher Portal Testnet](https://testnet-publisher.singularitynet.io/)  
   A private Publisher portal for publishing and configuring AI services in the User Test environment.

#### **UI Sandbox**

[AI UI Constructor](https://ai-ui-constructor.singularitynet.io/)  
**UI Sandbox** is a powerful and versatile development environment that provides tools for:

-   Creating custom modules and services.
-   Online compilation for instant testing.
-   Fast file upload and export for streamlined workflows.
-   Library of components for accelerated interface development.

The environment supports flexible customization, allowing users to write and compile code, create and reuse modules, and share them with other developers. This makes the development process efficient, collaborative, and adaptable to various use cases.

#### **Faucets**

1. [AGIX Faucet (Sepolia Network)](https://faucet.singularitynet.io/)  
   Allows users to receive test AGIX tokens for use in the Testnet. This ensures that testing and publishing services occur without the need for real tokens.

2. [ETH Faucet (Sepolia Network)](https://www.infura.io/zh/faucet/sepolia)  
   Provides test ETH for paying transaction fees on the Sepolia Testnet.

_Additional Note:_  
For testing environments, the **USER Test** option provides a private setup where users only see their own services. However, for collaborative or open testing, the **Test** option allows visibility of all services published on the Testnet by other users.
