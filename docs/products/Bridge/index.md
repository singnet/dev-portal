# What is the Bridge?

SingularityNET Bridge allows users to transfer their tokens across supported Blockchains. Currently, the bridge supports the following tokens:
- **AGIX**
- **NTX**
- **FET (ASI)**
- **WMTX**
- **RJV**
- **CGV**

The bridge will allow anyone to move `AGIX-ETH` from their Ethereum wallet into `AGIX-ADA` in their Cardano wallet, or vice versa (similarly for `NTX`, `FET`, `WMTX`, `RJV`, and `CGV`). When you move tokens from Ethereum to Cardano, you will burn the Ethereum-based tokens in a smart contract, and an equal amount of new tokens will be minted on Cardano for you. When you move back from Cardano to Ethereum, the Cardano-based tokens will get burned, and the same amount of Ethereum-based tokens will be minted on the Ethereum side, available for you to claim.


Here is a short animation that provides a visualization of how the process works:
