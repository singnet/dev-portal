**Overview**

The "View All" page in the TUI is an integral feature of the TUI. It allows the users to browse all the organizations, and their published services, on the network of the default identity signed into the TUI.&#x20;

In other words, if your default identity is on the main-net, you will see all the organizations and their services on the main-net. If your identity is on the Sepolia test-net, you will see all the organizations and services on the test-net.&#x20;

**Detailed Structure and Features**

* **Main Organization Display**
