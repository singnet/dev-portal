## Tutorial on developing a console calculator

This is an example of how to use SingularityNET Python SDK to create a console calculator that works using a service 
on the SingularityNET platform.

### Description

It is assumed that there is an application provider (developer), who pays for all the
transactions and service calls.

So, the application must have the next console interface:

```commandline
Welcome to the calculator powered by SingularityNET platform!
Please type the expression you want to calculate, e.g. 2 + 3.
Type 'exit' to exit the program.
Calculator> 34 * 4 
Calculating 34 * 4...
34 * 4 = 134
Calculator> 103 - 82
Calculating 103 - 82...
103 - 82 = 21
Calculator> exit
```

### Development

#### Install package

Before the beginning we need to install `snet.sdk` package:

```commandline
pip install snet.sdk
```

#### Configuration

Firstly, we need to configure sdk and service client. So we create a config dict and then an sdk instance with
that config. 

_Note:_ don't forget to import `snet.sdk` package.

```python
from snet import sdk

config = {
    "private_key": 'APP_PROVIDER_PRIVATE_KEY',
    "eth_rpc_endpoint": f"https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/INFURE_API_KEY",
    "concurrency": False,
    "identity_name": "NAME",
    "identity_type": "key",
    "network": "sepolia",
    "force_update": False
}

snet_sdk = sdk.SnetSDK(config)
```

Here you need to set private values: `private_key`, `eth_rpc_endpoint`, `identity_name` and possibly change some others.

Calculator service is deployed on the sepolia network. To create a client of this service we need to pass `org_id`, 
`service_id` and `group_name` to `create_service_client` method:

```python
calc_client = snet_sdk.create_service_client(org_id="26072b8b6a0e448180f8c0e702ab6d2f",
                                             service_id="Exampleservice", group_name="default_group")
```

#### User input parsing

Secondly, we need to write a function that will process and parse user input. 

```python
def parse_expression(expression):
    elements = list(expression.split())
    if len(elements) != 3:
        raise Exception(f"Invalid expression '{expression}'. Three items required.")

    a = int(elements[0])
    b = int(elements[2])
    if elements[1] not in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]:
        raise Exception(f"Invalid expression '{expression}'. Operation must be '+' or '-' or '*' or '/'")
    elif not isinstance(a, (float, int)) or not isinstance(b, (float, int)):
        raise Exception(f"Invalid expression '{expression}'. Operands must be integers or floating point numbers.")
    op = elements[1]

    return a, b, op
```

This function splits the passed expression entered by the user into separate elements and checks their correctness. 
In case of invalid input, exceptions are thrown, otherwise three elements of the required types are returned.

#### Main cycle

The calculator service accepts the name of the method on which the arithmetic operation depends. Therefore, we will 
add a dictionary to match the operation symbol and the method name in the service.

```python
operators = {
    "+": "add",
    "-": "sub",
    "*": "mul",
    "/": "div"
}
```

Now we can write the main function:

```python
def main():
    print("""
Welcome to the calculator powered by SingularityNET platform!
Please type the expression you want to calculate, e.g. 2 + 3.
Type 'exit' to exit the program.""")
    while True:
        expression = input("Calculator> ")
        if expression == "exit":
            break
        try:
            a, b, op = parse_expression(expression)
            print(f"Calculating {a} {op} {b}...")
            result = calc_client.call_rpc(operators[op], "Numbers", a=a, b=b)
            print(f"{a} {op} {b} = {result}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In an "infinite" loop, user input is read. If `exit` is entered, the program terminates. Otherwise, the expression 
is parsed using the `parse_expression` function and, if no errors occur, its result is calculated using the previously 
created instance of the ServiceClient class - `calc_client`, using `call_rpc` method. The result is then displayed 
on the screen.
