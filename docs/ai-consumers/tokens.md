## Introduction to AGI Tokens
The AGI Token is an ERC-20 token, which is hosted on the Ethereum Blockchain.

SingularityNET uses the AGI Token for any paid calls to a service.

## Testnet AGI vs Mainnet AGI
If you are unfamiliar with  Ethereum, it might be hard to understand between Testnet and Mainnet tokens. 
However, to understand the different network tokens, you can follow principles listed below:
* Testnet tokens are used to test software applications with, try out demos, or in our case the Beta.
* Mainnet tokens are used for officially deployed software.
* Testnet tokens never have a monetary value.
* Mainnet tokens could have a monetary value.
* Both tokens can be used to add extra utility to the software.

We only use Kovan and Ropsten Testnet AGI and the current beta stage. 

To learn more about  Mainnet AGI Token (to be used in a later stage) refer to this link [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285) with the address `0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285`.
