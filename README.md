Welcome to the [SingularityNET Developer Portal](https://dev.singularitynet.io)

Our Developer Portal provides documentation about the main products of SingularityNET


## Contributing
We are glad to see new contributors!
If you want to add a new document or request any edits, please:
1. Create a fork of this repo
2. Open the pull request to `development` branch with your edits

## Setup

For start development you need:

-   node 18.0.0 || >=20.0.0
-   npm >=8.0.0

Copy repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/singnet/dev-portal.git
```

```sh
cd dev-portal
```

then install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

and run project:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Update/Add Documents

If you want to update the documentation, change the corresponding files in `/docs/products/`. To add documentation files, place them in the appropriate product section and do not forget to add them to the sidebar (add the data to the `/config/content/sidebarContentConfig.ts` to the appropriate section). If a new documentation page requires images, add them to the appropriate folder in `/assets/images/`

Dev-portal-2 uses a library module with clean-URLs and for its correct operation it is necessary to store documents correctly.

Add all documents in individual folders and the entry point must be a file index.md
As shown in the diagram:

```
├─ getting-started
│  └─ index.md
├─ installation
│  └─ index.md
└─ index.md
```

If there are other files inside the folder, except index.md then the name of this folder should start with a capital letter. Otherwise, with lowercase.

### Add an image

To add an image to your document, please follow these steps:

1. Upload the file to `public/assets/images/products/name_of_product/name_of_subcategory/title_image`
2. Add next code:

```javascript
<ImageViewer
    src='/assets/images/products/path_to_your_file'
    alt='alt for image'
/>
```

If you want to add a description to an image, you should use the `pictureTitle` attribute. For example:

```javascript
<ImageViewer
    src='/assets/images/products/AIMarketplace/Marketplace/BasicScheme.webp'
    alt='Basic scheme'
    pictureTitle='Basic scheme'
/>
```

Result:
![imageViewerExample](public/assets/images/products/Readme/imageViewerExample.webp)

### Add a video

To add a video to your document, please follow these steps:

1. Upload the file to `public/assets/images/products/name_of_product/name_of_subcategory/title_image`
2. Add next code:

```javascript
<Video src="'/assets/images/products/path_to_your_file'" />
```

## Add new component

If you want to add a new one .vue component, you need to add these files to the appropriate folder in the `/components/` section or create a new folder if the existing ones are not suitable. Do not forget import new components in `/.vitepress/theme/index.ts`

Example:

```ts
...
import YourComponent from "/components/folder/YourComponent.vue";

export default {
    ...
    enhanceApp({ app, router, siteData }) {
        app.component("YourComponent", YourComponent);
        ...
    },
}
```

The default theme's <Layout/> component has a few slots that can be used to inject content at certain locations of the page. Check full list of slots here: https://vitepress.dev/guide/extending-default-theme#layout-slots

```ts
export default {
    extends: DefaultTheme,
    Layout: () => {
        return h(DefaultTheme.Layout, null, {
            "some-layout": () => h(YourComponent)
            ...
        });
    },
    ...
}
```
## Using the Accordion
To use the Accordion element, use the following syntax
```html
<AccordionItem :id="idHere">
    <template #title>
       title here
    </template>
    <template #description>
        content here
    </template>
</AccordionItem>
```
- To create an anchor link to an object, set the value of the parameter `:id`;
- Use the `<template #title>` tag to indicate the section header, for example, a frequently asked question;
- Use the `<template #description>` tag to indicate the part of the section to be disclosed, for example, the answer to a frequently asked question.

## Update existing config

if you want to change an existing config, you need to find the required file in the `/config/content` folder and change the required part. **Important**: Each config file has its own structure and in order not to cause conflicts, you need to adhere to it.
Also, some config files require an icon, they need to be added to an existing file (`/assets/images/sprite.svg`) and add an id to them

Example of adding an icon to a `sprite.svg`

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="display:none;">
    ...
    <symbol id="YourIconID" width="16" height="18" viewBox="0 0 16 18">
        <path
