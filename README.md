Welcome to the [SingularityNET Developer Portal](https://dev.singularitynet.io).

Our Developer Portal provides documentation about the SingularityNET Platform and Marketplace. You will learn how to build and access AI services that are published onto the network as a service developer or as an end-user of services that other people have published.

## Overview

If you are just starting out, read the [getting started](https://dev.singularitynet.io/tutorials/getting-started) page.

If you are already familiar with blockchain technology like MetaMask, Ethereum and AGI, then you may want to skip immediately to browsing the beta [Marketplace](http://beta.singularitynet.io).

## Setup

We welcome external contributions to our documentation, such as corrections, improvements, new tutorials, or any other suitable addition.
