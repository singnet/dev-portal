# SingularityNet workshop examples

Docker image and number of simple application examples which demonstrate how to
work with SingularityNet platform.

For the sake of clarity and simplicity it is a prepared environment which
simulates behaviour of the Ethereum testnet like Kovan. But all things you are
doing happens in your own instance of Ganache and doesn’t affect any public
networks.

Prerequisites:
* [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Hardware requirements:
* 1 Gb free RAM to run docker image
* 4 Gb free disk space to keep docker image

Clone repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/singnet/wiki
cd wiki/workshop/docker
```

Build docker image:
```sh
docker build -t singnet .
```

Run docker image with examples:
```sh
docker run -ti singnet
```

After docker image is up you will be in the `singnet` folder which contains all
main SingularityNet git repositories and SingularityNet examples.

Please start with reading `examples/01-snet-cli/README` file and follow instructions.
You can use preinstalled `vim` and `nano` editors to edit example files inside
container.

# Preparations made in image

What is done in the docker image:

* local IPFS instance is deployed and started (see [deploy local IPFS
  instance](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#deploy-local-ipfs-instance)
  and [start local IPFS
  instance](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#start-local-ipfs-instance)
* Ganache instance is started with predefined network number and mnemonic to
  generate predictable accounts numbers and private keys (see [start local
  ethereum
  network](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multipartyescrowcontract/front-to-back-examples/build-and-deploy-singularitynet-locally.md#start-local-ethereum-network));
* local network id is exported as `$NETWORK_ID` environment variable;
* all contracts are already deployed and their addresses are written to
  `snet-cli` configuration and exported as environment variables:
  `$TOKEN_ADDR`, `$REGISTRY_ADDR`, `$MULTIPARTYESCROW_ADDR`;
* local Ethereum node and IPFS instance are added into snet-cli configuration
  [setup snet-cli
  interface](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md#setup-snet-command-line-interface);
* all addresses and private keys generated by Ganache are exported as
  environment variables: `$DEPLOYER_ADDR`, `$DEPLOYER_KEY`, `$CALLER_ADDR`,
  `$CALLER_KEY`, `$PUBLISHER_ADDR`, `$PUBLISHED_KEY`;
* couple of `snet-cli` identities are created: `deployer` and `caller`, which
  are first and second identities generated by ganache-cli on start
  respectively.

In order to see full list of preparations you need to work with local Ethereum
network you need to look at page [build and deploy SingularityNet
locally](https://github.com/singnet/wiki/blob/master/multiPartyEscrowContract/front-to-back-examples/Build-and-deploy-SingularityNET-locally.md).
